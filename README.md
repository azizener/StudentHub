StudentHub

A simple and well-structured Spring Boot application demonstrating a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing student records.
This project follows best practices in layering with controller, service, repository, and DTO separation, along with global exception handling.
Ideal for learning and building upon Spring Boot fundamentals, REST API design, and clean architecture principles.
